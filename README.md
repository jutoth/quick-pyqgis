# Quick-PyQGIS: A PyQGIS Code Snippet Generator

This Plugin enables several actions in the QgisInterface, that generate PyQGIS Code Snippets from UI elements, ready to use in the QGIS Python console.

## Generate Code that recreates the selected layer via PyQGIS functions
Easily generate PyQGIS code that perfectly replicates any selected layer in your project. The generated code is automatically copied to your clipboard, allowing you to paste it directly into the Python console.
This feature is particularly helpful for:
- Sharing test data in forums (like Stack Exchange) without having to distribute files.
- Saving time by programmatically recreating layers with ease.
